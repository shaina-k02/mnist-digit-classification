- `data/`: Contains datasets and data-related files.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploration and experimentation.
- `src/`: Source code for data preparation, model definition, training, and evaluation.
- `models/`: Directory to save trained models.
- `scripts/`: Shell scripts to run the project pipeline.
- `requirements.txt`: Project dependencies.
